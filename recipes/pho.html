    <h3>Pho Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef bones and tough beef cuts</strong>: Beef pho broth usually involves leg and knuckle bones which lend beefy flavor and fat. Tough beef cuts may include oxtail (as Lett101 calls for in this recipe), which contributes its collagen for a rich mouthfeel; beef brisket, chuck, or other kinds of stewy cuts may be substituted, if you prefer boneless meat. Use what fits into your budget and is freshest at the store. </li>
        <li><strong>Flat rice noodles</strong>: These are similar to the ones used for pad Thai. They may be labeled banh pho at the supermarket or Asian grocer. Dried banh pho last a long time in the cupboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>: Ginger, onion (or shallot) lend sweet-spicy zip and a little pungent note too. </li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>: The spicing varies from cook to cook. For beef pho, there is typically star anise, cinnamon/cassia sticks, and clove. Here, Lett101 adds peppercorns for a pungent note. Regardless, make sure you use star anise with robust points so your broth gets lots of its savor. Each star anise has 8 points. It is okay to use broken ones. </li>
        <li><strong>Daikon</strong>: Adding daikon naturally adds earthy sweetness to the broth. Substitute turnip if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt, sugar, and fish sauce</strong>: These are the foundational pho seasonings. For the sugar, Chinese yellow rock sugar is often used for southern Vietnamese-style pho broth; if you donâ€™t have it, use granulated sugar (organic has a deeper flavor than white granulated sugar). A sweetener helps to round out pho broth flavor. Fish sauce, sold at many supermarkets and Asian markets, adds umami savoriness to the broth. </li>
        <li><storng>Steak</storng>: Choose a tender cut of steak. Splurge on marbled meat and slice it thin so it will be cooked quickly by the hot broth. If you do not like raw-ish meat, omit it and focus on the cooked beef!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately.</li>
        <li>Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
        <li>Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
